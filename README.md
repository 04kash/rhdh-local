# Run Backstage In Docker Locally

Useful for testing things like "Does my `catalog-info.yaml` work?"

Before commiting things like catalog info files or TechDocs, it's really useful to have somewhere to test if they all hang together correctly. Otherwise, with online systems, you do end up going through multiple loops of "commit, then test." This is very time consuming, and with online systems you may not have access to the logs required to troubleshoot any issues that may crop up - meaning you have to bother the platform engineers or admins for simple things.
